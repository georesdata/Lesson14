                    In my first career I was a drafter, with an Associates degree in Architectural Technology.  I decided that I wanted to move up to the level where I could be making decisions, so I went back to school.  The plan was that I would get a broad undergraduate degree and then go for a Masters in architecture.  So much for plans! --because along the way Geography captured me.  I love geography because I get to think spatially about whatever interests me, and see how everything is interrelated.  I love GIS, also, because it does the same thing for me that drafting did: bring together the hand, eye, and mind to create highly satisfying visual expressions of spatial information.
